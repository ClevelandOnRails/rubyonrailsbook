#Ruby on Rails: The little Gem that Could

##Welcome to the wide, wide world of Ruby on Rails

This is a Ruby on Rails book that is built for the sole purpose of teaching people who have very little/no programming skill at all

Required reading/classes/experience/etc:

- [tryruby.org](http://tryruby.org).
- [ruby.learncodethehardway.org](http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/).

If you go through those two (in that order), you will have the skills to go forth and follow this.

After going through 20 pages of google search results, and finding nothing useful that was licensed for commercial use, I decided to write one. Enjoy the fruits of my labors, and please, file a Github issue if you have problems.


License is the MIT license, in the LICENSE file.

Toss this into either your README, your Preface, or the credits. Whatever. I just need to be able to be mentioned somewhere. 

I'd also appreciate it if you emailed me a copy of whatever you build on top of this. I think it'd be really fun to read what people build on top of this. Anyway.

Credit to [mateo_salta](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/201?m=7659237#7659237) for the name.
