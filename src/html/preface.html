<p>
  I have read many books, but I haven't read most of the prefaces.

  Now that I am writing a book, I realize that this is one of the most important parts of a book. It is an opportunity for an author to write something down, and to reflect on the journey that the book has taken to get to where it is. 
</p>  
<p>
  I have many people to thank for the fact that this book actually got out the door.
</p>
<p>
  I have <a href="https://github.com/flabricorn">Elijah Snow-Rackley</a> to thank for helping write the book.
</p>
<p>
  I have <a href="https://github.com/snowypelican">Andrew Schellenberg</a> to thank for being our test pelican. We asked him to pick a title, and that's what he chose.
</p>
<p>
  I have <a href="https://twitter.com/DarCaldwell">Dar Caldwell</a> to thank for the encouragement.
</p>

<p>
  Mom & Dad, because they helped me setup my company, and have encouraged me to go forward with this. 
</p>
<p>
  And finally, I have you, the reader to thank. Somehow, you got your hands on this book. And because you have this book, I sincerely hope that you will enjoy reading it. And thanks for reading the preface. I never did.
