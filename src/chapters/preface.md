##Preface
**Shaker LaunchHouse, 2013.04.05, 12:48PM.**


  I have read many books, but I haven't read most of the prefaces.

  Now that I am writing a book, I realize that this is one of the most important parts of a book. It is an opportunity for an author to write something down, and to reflect on the journey that the book has taken to get to where it is. 


  I have many people to thank for the fact that this book actually got out the door.

  I have [Elijah Snow-Rackley]("https://github.com/flabricorn") to thank for helping write the book.

  I have [Andrew Schellenberg]("https://github.com/snowypelican") to thank for being our test pelican. We asked him to pick a title, and that's what he chose.


  I have [Dar Caldwell](https://twitter.com/DarCaldwell) to thank for the encouragement.


  Mom & Dad, because they helped me setup my company, and have encouraged me to go forward with this. 


  And finally, I have you, the reader to thank. Somehow, you got your hands on this book. And because you have this book, I sincerely hope that you will enjoy reading it. And thanks for reading the preface. I never did.
